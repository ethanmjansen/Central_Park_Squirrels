### From my Portfolio  

This app accuratley predicts if you can approach a squirrel and have it run away or not. It took around 40 hours to complete and I am very happy with the end result. Up until this point this is the most intelligent thing I have ever created, a predictive model with interactive capabilities. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  

### Looking Back 

In retrospect, this is the most intelligent thing I have ever conceived and created. I love my neural network projects and Conway's Game of Life but this project reminds me of a man with an immature understanding of programming. Despite the young understanding of writing intelligent software, it still holds up very well. There's humor, reflection, and tenacity shown in this project.
